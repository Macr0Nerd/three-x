# Three X
What in the hell is this?
This, my friend, is a bored programmer's attempt to disprove one of the most infuriating math problems ever.

The Collatz Conjecture states that any number that has the following rules applied:
 * If odd, multiply by three and add one
 * If even, divide by two
and continued to be applied to the result will always end in a 4-2-1 loop.

Always.

And mathematicians are too busy trying to prove it that no one is focusing on disproving it.

Save for me.

Now I know this isn't going anywhere, but it was fun building it.
Maybe I'll add parallelism and shoot Google an email to borrow their super computer.
Who knows, maybe then we'll disprove it.
